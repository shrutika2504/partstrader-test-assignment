# PartsTrader Test Assignment

## 📌 Purpose

This repository contains the **PartsTrader test assignment**, designed to demonstrate proficiency in automated testing using **Playwright**.

### Key Features:

- ✅ UI test scripts written in **TypeScript** using the **Playwright** framework.
- 🧱 Implementation of the **Page Object Model (POM)** for maintainable and scalable test architecture.
- 📊 Integration with **HTML reporting** for clear visibility into test results.
- 📥 Support for **external input data** to drive test scenarios dynamically.
- 🌐 **API testing utilities** using Playwright’s `APIRequestContext` to validate backend endpoints alongside UI workflows.
